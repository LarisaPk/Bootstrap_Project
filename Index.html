    <h4>Alicante August 2017</h4>
    <a href="images/photo1.jpg"> <img src="images/photo1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="View of Alicante bay from Santa Barbara Castle" title="View of Alicante bay from Santa Barbara Castle" width="250"/></a><p>Alicante is not very big city in Spain just next to the sea. It took me only 2 days to see all the tourist attractions and I never needed to use the public transport. It is very waklable and nice. When I was there it was August and water in the sea was very warm. I could swim for hours and enjoy it. Weather was also very nice and hot. But it was just what I needed after very cold and rainy finnish summer.</p>

    <h4>Barcelona June 2017</h4>
    <a href="images/barcelona1.jpg"><img src="images/barcelona1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded"  alt="Barcelona Park Güell" title="Barcelona Park Güell" width="250"/></a>
    <p>Barcelona is a very bid city. VERY big. We stayed there with my husband for 2 weeks and every day there was something new to do. The places to explore was never over. We was from the morning till the evening outside, walking around and visiting different touristic places. Every day we can not feel our legs after this much walking, and even after two weeks thre was something we have not yet visited. One disapointment was the sea. I expected it to be warm in June, but no. It was cold like the lakes in Finland. So I tried to swim, but could not stay longer then few minutes.</p></div>

    <h4>Berlin February 2017</h4>
    <a href="images/berlin1.jpg"><img src="images/berlin1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Deutscher Bundestag" title="Deutscher Bundestag " width="250"/></a>
    <p>I went to Berlin in February just for 5 days, because I had a spring break in the College. The weather was a bit cold and it was rainy almost every day. If you are made out of sugar - February it is not the time to go to Berlin. But city is nice and big, there are many interesting places. And of course I visited Bundestag, to see how it looks like in real life. It was also free, so very good option. I walked a lot and felt like new when I came back to Helsinki.</p>

    <h4>Stockholm. Every time</h4>
    <a href="images/Stockholm1.jpg"><img src="images/Stockholm1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" id="img1" alt="Stockholm Old Town" title="Stockholm Old Town" width="250"/></a>
    <p>I think that this is already part of many people's life-style. Especially those who live in Helsinki. Because when ferry companies have a cheap offers for Stockholm cruise no one can stand. Even though, food and drinks are expencive on the ferry, and I even sometimes call it FerryTrap. Every time I go again. With friends it is even better. But it is actually nice to have a small break from every day routine and just walk for a few hours in Stockholm...before come back to ferry.</p>
